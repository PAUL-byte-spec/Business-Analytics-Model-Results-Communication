# Step-by-Step Instructions for Executing Code in Jupyter Notebook
# Import Necessary Libraries:

* pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
* sklearn: for machine learning algorithms and tools
* numpy: for numerical computing
* plotly: for interactive data visualization
* matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
* python: the Python programming language itself
  
# Load Data CSV:
* The cleaned dataset.csv was loaded into the jupyter notebook. 

# Model Training:
Train machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data. Appropriate algorithms such as logistic regression. The goal is to build models that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn in the future.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of trained models using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,F1-score, Mean squared error, and R squared. This step helps assess how well the models generalize to unseen data and identify potential areas for improvement.

# Bar Chart Using State and Churn as Variables:
Bar chart was created to visualize the relationship between customer churn and geographic location (state). This provide insights into regional variations in churn rates and inform targeted marketing or retention strategies.

# Additional Notes
All necessary dependencies are installed in Python environment before executing the code.
The provided Jupyter notebook contains detailed code snippets and explanations for each step outlined above.
Feel free to customize the code and analysis according to your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.
